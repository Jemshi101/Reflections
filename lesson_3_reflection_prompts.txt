When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    remote repository helps in collaborating as well as work from different locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    We may not want the local to be up to date with the remote if we are currently working on some feature. If the remote is synced automatically, the changes that was not committed, might be lost. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is used for cloning a github repository to another github repository directly.
	Clone is a complete copy of a remote or local repository in another place.
	Branches are the different copy of commits used for differentiating an experimental or version of the original code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

	This will let us know whether the master is in sync with the remote branch. and we can take appropriate measures to make them in sync.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Changes made by others will have to be cross checked with the changes we made by sending each other the codes and keep those which will work without changes and change those which needed changes. It will be harder to keep track of the changes.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
